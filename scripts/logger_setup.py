    Purpose of the Script:
          The script is used to create a Centralized Log folder where the logs of each script is kept.
          It is a best practie to keep all the logs at a single place / folder. It checks if the logs
          folder exist or not, if not creates the logs folder. Then we create a logger object that is 
          the log file and for that file we set a handler to decide where the information should be
          kept. Formatter is used to tell how the information is stored.

    This function is called via the concept of module
      to call: 
              from logger_setup import get_logger
              log_variable = get_logger("Filename")
